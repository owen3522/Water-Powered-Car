<h1>Water Powered Car - Introduction to Engineering II</h1>

<h2>Project Task</h2>
- <b>Design and build a car whose sole source of power will be water stored in a two-liter plastic soda bottle</b>

<h2>Project Constraints</h2>

- <b>The device should be powered by the energy stored in the water in a two-liter plastic soda bottle</b>
- <b>The car will be tested on a flat surface. The distance will be measured from the starting line to the farthest point traveled using a straight line to connect the two using points.</b>
- <b>There will be two runs for each car; the single best performance will be used for final scoring</b>
- <b>Use of tapes of any kind, Velcro, Glue, Zip ties, rubber bands etc. are prohibited, use of nuts, bolts, screws, and rivets are allowed</b>
- <b>No chemical reactions are allowed</b>
- <b>The material for the device should not cost more than $30</b>
- <b>The materials must be from commercial sources</b>
